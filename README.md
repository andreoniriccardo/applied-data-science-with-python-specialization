# Applied Data Science with Python Specialization
This specialization is composed of 5 independent courses.

In this document, for each course, I summarize what I learned, how it enhanced my data scientist skills and what programming assignment consists to.

This GitHub repository contains all the coding material that I wrote and studied for this specialization.

## 01 - Introduction to Data Science in Python

---
## 02 - [Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-plotting/home/welcome)
### How did this course enhance my Data Science skills?
- I know the main principles for information visualization, including heuristics as data-ink ratio, chart junk and lie factors
- I know how to code with the most popular python charting libraries as Matplotlib and Seaborn
- I know how to generate different types of charts and the ratio behind them
- I know how to add animations and interactivity to a chart
- I know hot to fetch, read, clean and extract insightful graphics from real-world dataset
- I am able to address research questions by creating visuals from real-world data

### What does this course deal?
- Principles of information visualization
	- **Data-ink ratio**
	- **Chart junk**
	- **Lie Factor**
- Charting
	- **Matplotlib** architecture
	- **Scatterplots**
	- **Line plots**
	- **Bar Charts**
	- Subplots
	- **Histograms**
	- **Box plots**
	- **Heatmaps**
	- **Animation**
	- **Interactivity**
- Appied Visualization
	- Plotting with **Pandas**
	- **Seaborn**

### Coding assignments
- **Plotting Weather Patterns**: reading a real world data contained in a csv file and plotting insightful information
- **Building a Custom Visualization**: generating and insightful visual about probabilistic data using Matplotlib
- **Final project**: identification of public datasets from a geographical region, stating a research question that can be answered using the datasets and creating a visual that addresses the research question
