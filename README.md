# Applied Data Science with Python Specialization
This specialization is composed of 5 independent courses.
In this document, for each course, I summarize what I learned, how it enhanced my data scientist skills and what programming assignment consists to.
This GitHub repository contains all the coding material that I wrote and studied for this specialization.

## 01 - Introduction to Data Science in Python
